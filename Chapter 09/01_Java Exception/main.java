 * 1. Runtime Exception - also known as Unchecked Exception.
 * 2. IO Exception - also known as checked exception.
 * 
 * # Runtime Exception :-
 * Runtime Exception happens due to a programming error.They are checked at
 * runtime (during the execution of the program).
 * 
 * Arithmetic Exception- dividing by zero.
 * ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception - n-accessing array with an index greater
 * than the size of the array.
 * NullPointerException - missing the intialization of a variable.
