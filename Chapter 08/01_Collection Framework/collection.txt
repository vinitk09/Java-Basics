Collection Framework :-
=> The collection framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provides implementation of commonly used data structures and algorithms in Java.

For Example,we can use the LinkedList class of the collection framework to implement the linked list data structure.


# Advantages of Linked List :
The use of collection  framework makes it really easy to implement various data structure and reduces the complexity of writing code.
It also provides data structure for specific types of data.
For example :-
1.Set - For unique data.
2.Map - To store data in key/value pairs.

# Commonly used Collection:

1.Arraylist
2.LinkedList
3.Hashset
4.HashMap
5.Algorithms
